### Easy steps for Arch Linux installation & configuration<br><br>

This is a simple set of steps to achieve a minimal [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) install.

The starting point is assuming you already have a [bootable device](https://archlinux.org/download/) and booted under UEFI mode.

It is by no means the best, or most efficient way to do this, but it works for me, and hopefully more people as well.<br><br>
