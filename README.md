### Easy steps for Arch Linux installation.<br><br>

This is a simple set of steps to achieve a minimal [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) install.
The starting point is assuming you already have a [bootable device](https://archlinux.org/download/).

This is by no means the best, or most efficient way to do this, but its what works for me, and hopefully more people as well.
